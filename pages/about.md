## About the Collection

This collection contains recipes collected by my grandmother, Jean Harris, and her mother, Christine West. A majority of these recipes are from the 1950s and 1960s. All of them contain missing information, whether that be amounts, methods, or even ingredients. I was inspired to consider what I can learn from these knowledge gaps. What knowledge is assumed? What was common for the 50s chef that no longer holds true today? While these recipes have been passed down to me, not everything transfers. It's in these gaps that I hope to gain a deeper understanding of my grandmother's kitchen.
